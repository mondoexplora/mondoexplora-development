12:T650,Immerse yourself in the magic of West Hollywood with an escape at the beautifully bohemian Petit Ermitage. Perched between two of California's most famous boulevards - Sunset and Santa Monica - this chic boutique bolthole is perfectly located for all your Golden State adventures. Remarkable restaurants and brilliant bars are within walking distance, and it's an easy 15-minute drive to the boutiques of Beverly Hills and thrills of Universal Studios. Petit Ermitage is a haven of European eccentricity, with suites that celebrate vintage styling and splashes of Parisian, Spanish and Moroccan-inspired design. That boutique feel continues in the common areas, with walls lined with original art from the owner‚Äôs eclectic collection - think Miro, de Kooning and Dali. However, it‚Äôs at the rooftop pool where the fun truly begins: sun yourself on one of the striped daybeds while admiring views of the Hills or settle in for a swim - it‚Äôs heated and saltwater, so it‚Äôs comfortable no matter the time of year. A nearby fire deck comes to life at sundown, best admired with a cocktail in hand from Butterfly Bar. When hunger strikes, turn to the expansive alfresco restaurant, which also doubles as a hummingbird and butterfly sanctuary. **Luxury Escapes inclusions** - Toast your Hollywood adventure with a **complimentary bottle of wine** from the minibar - Live the high life with an **upgrade to the next suite category**, subject to availability **One-Bedroom Suite Upgrade:** Spread out in the charming One-Bedroom Suite, complete with kitchenette (most rooms), king-sized bed and a separate living area.5:["$","main",null,{"className":"min-h-screen","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"hero-section","style":{"backgroundImage":"linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6) 0%, rgba(42, 63, 89, 0.8) 100%), url(https://images.luxuryescapes.com/spdn7gwrtcav7c41o0dj)"},"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"page-header","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"logo-overlay","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"Mondo"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Explora"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-center text-white","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"page-header h1","children":"Hotels in California"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"page-header p","children":"Discover the best hotels in California, United States.
