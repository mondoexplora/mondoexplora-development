12:T57b,Immerse yourself in the heritage and grandeur of Italy's floating city with a stay at Venice's stylishly sophisticated Il Palazzo Experimental, a converted Renaissance-era palace nestled on the northern edge of the Giudecca Canal. The boutique hotel balances the best of the famous canal city: hidden away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist-filled laneways and yet within easy reach of iconic attractions, including St Mark‚Äôs Basilica and Accademia Gallery. Surrounded by famously good restaurants and bars, and within easy walking distance of two vaporetto stops, it‚Äôs perfectly positioned for days spent eating and exploring. French designer Doroth√©e Meilichzon transformed the Il Palazzo Experimental into a seaside haven, introducing an Art Deco sophistication while maintaining the exposed beams and Gothic windows of the original palace. Ascend to the signature city-view cocktail bar to watch vaporettos buzz up and down the Giudecca Canal and perhaps savour a cicchetti or two with an aperitivo, summon a gondola to the palazzo's private pier or sequester yourself in the hotel's breathtaking garden, where you‚Äôll have a front-row seat to all the locals‚Äô comings and goings. Delve into the tastes of southern Italy with an evening in Ristorante Adriatica or settle in for cocktails at the Experimental Cocktail Club, where expert bartenders will shake or stir anything you fancy.5:["$","main",null,{"className":"min-h-screen","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"hero-section","style":{"backgroundImage":"linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6) 0%, rgba(42, 63, 89, 0.8) 100%), url(https://images.luxuryescapes.com/xg5nm4az8p93lgz5c25)"},"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"page-header","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"logo-overlay","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"Mondo"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Explora"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-center text-white","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"page-header h1","children":"Hotels in Venice"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"page-header p","children":"Discover the best hotels in Venice, Italy.
