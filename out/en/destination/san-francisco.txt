Promising an out-of-the-ordinary stay, this stylish launchpad nestled near Union Square offers a luxe experience that is totally unique.

Visit Pineapple Bistro & Bar and order yourself a signature cocktail before hitting the town, then borrow a beach cruiser bicycle and cycle around or simply spend your time exploring one of the world’s most amazing cities on foot. Housed in a historic building, smack-bang in the thick of it, the hotel affords easy access to a plethora of attractions, boutiques, cafés, theatres and parks. You'll be steps from the instantly recognisable cable cars and in close proximity to Market Street, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the iconic districts of Chinatown, Telegraph Hill, Embarcadero and SoMa. This chic hotel received a Tripadvisor Travellers’ Choice 2021 award, placing it among the top 10% of properties worldwide on the review site.13:T54b,Awaken your creative soul at a luxurious San Francisco launchpad that defies the norm: Hotel Emblem San Francisco - an audaciously expressive hotel inspired by some of the world’s greatest writers, artists, poets and rabble-rousers. Every corner is designed to spark the imagination, from bottled cocktails delivered to your door to the book-filled Writer’s Alcove in the lobby and the quirky guestrooms, where colours and patterns play. Standing loud and proud on the intersection of iconic neighbourhoods Nob Hill, Union Square and the glitzy Theater District, this eclectic haven offers easy access to San Fran's most storied landmarks and locations. Follow a self-guided tour from the hotel's Underground Concierge to find under-the-radar local sights that will ignite your curiosity.

After days filled with exploring, hang out at the hotel and spark conversation over handcrafted cocktails in the sleek Obscenity Bar & Lounge, hire a selection of unorthodox amenities - from tarot cards to record players, colouring books to meditation bowls - or sit back and record your experiences on the lobby typewriter.5:["$","main",null,{"className":"min-h-screen","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"hero-section","style":{"backgroundImage":"linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6) 0%, rgba(42, 63, 89, 0.8) 100%), url(https://images.luxuryescapes.com/ennft9rjpq0dypqyroph)"},"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"page-header","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"logo-overlay","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"Mondo"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Explora"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-center text-white","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"page-header h1","children":"Hotels in San Francisco"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"page-header p","children":"Discover the best hotels in San Francisco, United States.
